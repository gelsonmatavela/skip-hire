# SKIP HIRE CHALLENGE | WE WANT WASTE  / USE THIS CODE AND LINK FOR TEST THE PROJECT 

## LINK: https://wewantwaste.vercel.app
## CODE: LE10 1SH

## Project Overview
I redesigned the project while maintaining its core identity, refining the grid structure and improving the layout presentation.

Through my research, I identified that **REM WASTE** places great emphasis on ensuring an optimal user experience when engaging with their services. With that in mind, I implemented a **clean and well-organized** code structure, making it accessible to any developer.

### Design Improvements
1. **Minimalist Header:** Removed the horizontal line at the top of the layout to enhance minimalism.
2. **Optimized Layout:** Adjusted the positioning of images and input fields on the main screen (`index`). On larger devices, the image is now placed at the top, while the **"SKIP HIRE With A Difference"** text is positioned below, ensuring that it captures user attention for at least 4 seconds, increasing curiosity.
3. **Improved Input Field UX:** Removed the loading circle inside the input field on the home screen, making the interface cleaner and preventing overlap with the existing "X" button.

## Technologies Used
For the creation and redesign of the web page, I utilized:
- **React.js (Next.js)**
- **TypeScript**

These technologies ensure enhanced performance and dynamic rendering of data.

## Clean Code Practices
I followed **clean code principles** to maintain high-quality software development standards. The structure includes:
- A dedicated `components` folder for each screen.
- A **global** `components` folder for reusable elements shared across the project.

This modular approach improves maintainability and scalability.
